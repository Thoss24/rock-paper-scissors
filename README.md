## rock-paper-scissors game

Currently the game is only playable from inside the browser console. But upon loading the page the user will be prompted to choose 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors'. It is currently best out of 5 and will display either "Player wins" or "Computer wins" depending on who won the most rounds.

I will revisit this game at some point to add a Graphical User Interface with buttons and text to make playable from outside of the browser console and more visually appealing.
